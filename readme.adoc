= C# Print Formats

To those of us who many years ago learned `printf`, C# print formats can be hard to remember. This is, partly of course, due to the fact that
our brains have atrophied since that golden era.

Here is a simple guide.

== Interpolated strings

C# was the first language to support the concept of interpolated strings - many other languages have followed this lead. Before C# 6, you would need to print
a string as follows:

[source,csharp]
----
private static void Main()
{
    var entity = "world";
    Console.WriteLine("Hello {0}", entity);
}
----

Now the same code can be written as

[source,csharp]
----
private static void Main()
{
    var entity = "world";
    Console.WriteLine($"Hello {entity}");
}
----

This is a lot more readable and allows a simple way of concatenating multiple strings. You don't have to print the result: you can use the value 
returned (which is of type `System.String` aka `string`). For example:

[source,csharp]
----
private static void Main()
{
    var entity = "world";
    var greeting = "Hello";
    var phrase = $"{greeting} {entity}";
    Console.WriteLine(phrase);
}
----

== Printing integers

=== Leading Spaces
